## You can use this application like a printed lexicon.

On the left are two columns. The first is the Latin alphabet. You can click on a letter to load entries beginning with that letter in the second-from-left column.

The list of word-entries scrolls. Click on a word to see its entry in the dictionary.

## You can look up Latin words by typing

You can find entries for Greek words by typing in this box. **Use lower-case only.**

![Type here to find Latin words.](images/type.jpg)

As you type, suggested Latin words will appear in the scrolling list below. The suggestions appear, in that list, in the following order:

1. Lexicon entries that exactly match what you typed.
1. Lexicon entries that *start with* what you typed.
1. Lexicon entries that *include* what you typed.

Click on one of the suggestions to see the article for that word.

![Suggestions based on what you typed.](images/suggestions.jpg)

## You can search the whole dictionary.

You can search across the dictionary for entries whose article contain a given word or phrase. The application will look for exact matches.

## You can link directly to entries.

Each entry has a unique id in the form `urn:cite2:…`. These appear on the right of the article's display.

![The URN that uniquely identifies an entry.](images/urn.jpg)

![Hover or click to see that is really a link directly to this entry.](images/link.jpg)

When you put the cursor over that URN, you can see it identifies itself as a link. Clicking on that will re-load the page, with the entry identified in the URL, like this:

> `…index.html?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n21247`
> (It is simply the URL to the lexicon-app, with a "search-parameter", `?urn=` , followed by a URN.)

That link can be shared or included in an online publication.

## Accessing the data directly

There is a link to the raw data for the *Lewis & Short*. You can download that data and search, analyze, or transform it however you like. The `.cex` file is self-describing.
